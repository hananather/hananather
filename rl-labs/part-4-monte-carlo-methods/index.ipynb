    "So far, we\u2019ve seen how to evaluate and improve policies with a known model (DP) and how to handle simple bandits. Now we tackle model-free prediction and control using Monte Carlo (MC) methods. Monte Carlo methods learn from sample episodes \u2014 they require no knowledge of environment probabilities, only the ability to sample episodes by interacting with the environment.\n\n\n**Monte Carlo Prediction**: Estimate the value function $v_{\\pi}(s)$ by averaging returns observed after visits to state s under policy \u03c0\n\n**First-Visit vs Every-Visit MC**: Two ways to handle multiple visits to a state in an episode:\n- **First-Visit MC**: Only use the first time a state is visited in each episode to update its value\n- **Every-Visit MC**: Use every occurrence of the state in the episode to update the average (still converges to true value, but observations are not independent)\n\n**Monte Carlo Control**: \nImprove policy using MC estimates. Requires enough exploration through either:\n- Using Exploring Starts (start episodes in all state-action pairs eventually) or\n- Using $\\epsilon$-soft policies (policy that always has a non-zero chance to explore all actions)\n\nWe will illustrate MC prediction and control on the Gambler's Problem (from section 2) for practice, and also demonstrate the concepts in the Grid World.\n\n## Monte Carlo Prediction (Policy Evaluation)\n\nLet\u2019s return to the gambler environment (small version: goal=10, p=0.5) and evaluate the policy \u201calways bet 1\u201d via Monte Carlo simulation, instead of using the known probabilities.\nWe will implement first-visit MC prediction:\n1. Simulate many episodes using the policy.\n2. For each episode, record the return $G_t$ from each state visited.\n3. Update the value estimate for the first visit of each state by averaging the returns.\n\nBecause the reward is 0 until the end and 1 at goal, the return is essentially 1 if the episode ends in success, 0 if failure. So the value of a state is the probability of eventually succeeding from that state (as earlier)."

    "**Understanding Optimal Betting Strategy in the Gambler's Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "When p < 0.5 (unfair coin), the optimal betting strategy might seem counterintuitive at first. Let's understand why making larger bets is actually optimal in this scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a gambler who needs to win $3 with p = 0.4 (40% chance of winning each bet). They have two possible strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conservative Strategy**: Bet $1 three times\n",
    "   - Need to win all three bets to reach goal\n",
    "   - Probability = 0.4 * 0.4 * 0.4 = 0.064 (6.4% chance of success)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Aggressive Strategy**: Bet $3 once\n",
    "   - Need to win just one bet\n",
    "   - Probability = 0.4 (40% chance of success)\n",
    "\n",
    "The aggressive strategy is clearly superior here. This illustrates a fundamental principle: when the odds are against you (p < 0.5), making multiple small bets is worse than making fewer larger bets. This is because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each bet has an expected negative return\n",
    "- More bets means more opportunities for the negative expected value to manifest\n",
    "- The law of large numbers works against you, pushing your results toward the negative expected value\n",
    "- By making fewer, larger bets, you minimize exposure to the unfavorable odds\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why our Monte Carlo control algorithm, starting from a conservative \"bet 1\" policy, will eventually learn to make larger bets when p < 0.5. The Q-values for larger bets will yield higher expected returns, leading to policy improvement in this direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Monte Carlo might need many episodes to converge on the optimal policy, especially for nontrivial p. We used exploring starts to ensure all actions are tried. Without exploring starts, we could use an \u03b5-greedy policy improvement (on-policy MC control) where we ensure the policy occasionally tries suboptimal actions \ufffc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 1:** Implement Monte Carlo prediction and control for the Grid World environment. Compare the learned value functions and policies with those obtained from Dynamic Programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 2:** Apply Monte Carlo methods to learn optimal play in Blackjack, following the example in Sutton & Barto. Analyze how the learned strategy compares to basic strategy tables used by players.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 3:** Implement on-policy Monte Carlo control using an $\\epsilon$-soft policy instead of exploring starts:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Initialize a policy $\\pi$ that is $\\epsilon$-greedy with respect to $Q$, ensuring $P(a|s) > 0$ for all state-action pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Generate complete episodes by following policy $\\pi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) For each state-action pair $(s,a)$ visited in the episode, update the action-value function $Q(s,a)$ using the observed returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) Improve policy $\\pi$ by making it more greedy with respect to $Q$ while maintaining $\\epsilon$-softness (i.e., ensure all actions still have some non-zero probability of being selected). Compare the learning performance with the exploring starts approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo methods allow us to learn value functions and policies from experience:\n",
    "- We estimated values by averaging returns (the essence of Monte Carlo prediction)\n",
    "- We saw first-visit vs every-visit approaches, which both converge to true values\n",
    "- For control, we ensured sufficient exploration either via exploring starts or maintaining an \u03b5-soft policy, then improved towards optimal by comparing action returns.\n",
    "- MC methods wait until an episode ends to update, which can be a downside for long episodes or continuing tasks.\n",

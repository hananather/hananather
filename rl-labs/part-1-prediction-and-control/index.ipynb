    "Now that we\u2019ve covered basic probability, let\u2019s dive into a simple reinforcement learning scenario: a gambling game. This example will introduce core RL ideas of prediction (evaluating how good a given strategy is) and control (finding a better strategy). We will define a simple gambling environment and simulate an agent\u2019s decisions within it.\n\n### Problem Setup: A Gambler\u2019s Game\nImagine a gambler who starts with a certain amount of money and aims to reach a target amount. At each turn, the gambler can bet some of their money on a coin flip:\n- If the coin comes up Heads (win), the gambler wins the amount bet (it gets added to their capital).\n- If Tails (lose), the gambler loses the amount bet (subtracted from their capital).\n- The coin might be biased with probability p of Heads.\n\nThe game ends either when the gambler reaches the target (goal) or loses all money (bust).\n\n\nThis is known as the Gambler\u2019s Problem from Sutton and Barto\u2019s RL textbook. \n- States: The gambler\u2019s capital (from $0$ to $Goal$).\n- Actions: The bet amount (from $1$ up to the smaller of current capital or amount needed to reach goal).\n- Transition: Win or lose based on the coin flip.\n- Reward: We can define a reward of +1 for reaching the goal, and 0 otherwise (no reward each step except at the end). This way, maximizing total reward is equivalent to maximizing the probability of reaching the goal.\n\nFor simplicity, let\u2019s implement a smaller version: goal = $10, starting capital = $5, and a fair coin (p = 0.5). The gambler can bet $1 each turn (to keep it simple initially).\n\n\n#### Simulation of a Fixed Policy\n\nPolicy: Let\u2019s start with a simple policy: always bet $1 until the game ends.\n\n\nWe will simulate many episodes (games) with this policy to estimate:\n- Probability of reaching the goal (this is the value of the starting state under this policy).\n- The distribution of episode lengths (how many bets until finish).\n\nLet\u2019s write a simulation for one episode and then loop it for many episodes."

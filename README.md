# Hanan Ather

I am a Member of Technical Staff at the Centre for AI Research and Excellence (CAIRE) at [Statistics Canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/start).
I build full-stack AI systems and the evals that make them safe to deploy in confidential-data settings.

My current research focus is on AI security, mechanistic interpretability, and uncertainty quantification for LLM-enabled workflows.

I am a Member of Technical Staff at the Centre for AI Research and Excellence (CAIRE) at **[Statistics Canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/start)**.
I build full-stack AI systems and the evals that make them safe to deploy in confidential-data settings, with a focus on LLM evals, AI safety, and AI security.
My research focus is on developing statistical methods for uncertainty quantification (conformal prediction, prediction-powered inference) and quality assurance of AI systems. 
Prior experience in SWE (full-stack), data engineering, and ML research (details in [my CV](website_docs/hanan-ather-cv.pdf)).
I am also a member of the Office of Responsible AI, where I lead technical reviews of AI systems across government and contribute to AI frameworks and governance guidance for **[UNECE](https://unece.org/statistics)**, **[G7 GovAI](https://impact.canada.ca/en/challenges/g7-govAI)**, and the **[International Statistical Institute (ISI)](https://www.isi-web.org/)**.

- Selected as a [MATS 10.0 Scholar](https://www.matsprogram.org/cohort/mats-10-0){.mats-link} in [Neel Nanda](https://www.matsprogram.org/mentor/neel)’s stream.
- Won [International Association for Official Statistics Young Statisticians Prize 2025](https://iaos-isi.org/ysp/) for a Bayesian framework integrating LLMs with uncertainty quantification.

- [Master of Science in Mathematics and Statistics](https://catalogue.uottawa.ca/en/graduate/master-science-mathematics-statistics-concentration-statistics/) at the University of Ottawa
  - Research topic: [Deep Reinforcement Learning and Function Optimization](website_docs/master-thesis-deep-reinforcement-learning.pdf){.accent-link}

## Projects

- I built [Probability Lab](https://www.probability-lab.com/), an interactive probability and statistics platform currently in use at the University of Ottawa's second-year engineering program.
- I published a 6-part series of reinforcement learning labs (Jupyter notebooks): [Reinforcement Learning Labs](rl-labs/).

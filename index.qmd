I am a Member of Technical Staff at the Centre for AI Research and Excellence (CAIRE) at **[Statistics Canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/start)**.
My research has focused on uncertainty quantification for LLMs (calibration + conformal prediction) and AI security & safety for confidential-data settings (data privacy, threat modeling, and evaluation).
I’m a member of the Office of Responsible AI, where I lead technical reviews of AI systems across government and contribute to AI frameworks and governance guidance for international bodies including **[UNECE](https://unece.org/statistics)**, **[G7 GovAI](https://impact.canada.ca/en/challenges/g7-govAI)**, and the **[International Statistical Institute (ISI)](https://www.isi-web.org/)**.

- Selected as a [MATS 10.0 Math Scholar](https://www.matsprogram.org/cohort/mats-10-0){.mats-link} in [Neel Nanda](https://www.matsprogram.org/mentor/neel)’s stream.
- Won [International Association for Official Statistics Young Statisticians Prize 2025](https://iaos-isi.org/ysp/) for a Bayesian framework integrating LLMs with calibrated uncertainty.

## Projects

- I built [Probability Lab](https://www.probability-lab.com/), an interactive learning platform for probability, statistics, and linear regression.
- I published a 6-part series of reinforcement learning labs (Jupyter notebooks): [Reinforcement Learning Labs](rl-labs/).
